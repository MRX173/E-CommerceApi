# E-Commerce API (C# .NET Core, Entity Framework, CQRS, DDD)

This project is an e-commerce API built with modern .NET Core principles, leveraging Entity Framework for data access, CQRS and DDD for clean architecture, and the repository pattern with unit of work for data persistence management.

Features
CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for core e-commerce entities (products, categories, orders, customers, etc.).
CQRS Pattern: Clear separation of concerns between queries and commands, improving maintainability and scalability.
Domain-Driven Design (DDD): Entity modeling that reflects real-world e-commerce domain concepts, fostering a well-structured codebase.
Repository Pattern: Abstracted data access layer for flexible switching between different data providers.
Unit of Work: Ensures transaction consistency and simplifies data persistence operations.
